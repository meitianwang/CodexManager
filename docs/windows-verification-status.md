# Windows Verification Status

Last updated: 2026-06-01 Asia/Shanghai.

This file tracks current evidence for the Windows app goal. It is not a release note and does not replace the manual checklist in `docs/release-windows.md`.

## Automated Evidence

- Windows CI run: https://github.com/meitianwang/CodexManager/actions/runs/26719934883
- Commit: `53100b3cb8cfabfdbc345a0923053f42debbbc4b`
- Result: success.
- Automated verification artifact: `CodexManager-Windows-Automated-Verification`, digest `sha256:11b0517dc5b38180960b063ae32407323521c63370828310a648c33817de5658`.
- Windows Squirrel artifact: `CodexManager-Windows-x64-Squirrel`, digest `sha256:ba1de27c4b54a9f08461d20eb424182876389f776757ecf4f3c764b2d37ce284`.
- Smoke screenshots artifact: `CodexManager-Windows-Smoke-Screenshots`, digest `sha256:1989f7e329fb56d2a764a280454d821eea2a4b4fa5f0de25cbaf42223ac3ee57`.
- Packaged smoke result: passed.
- Packaged UI screenshots: Accounts, Proxy, and Settings screenshots were recorded at `944x471` with non-trivial file sizes.
- Packaged Proxy route smoke: `/v1/models`, `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`, `/v1/responses/compact`, `/v1/memories/trace_summarize`, `/v1/alpha/search`, and `/v1/messages` all returned `200` through smoke-safe upstream routing.
- Packaged Proxy auth smoke: missing and wrong API keys returned `401`.
- Packaged account workflows: smoke-safe OAuth import, current auth import, standalone auth file import, account package import/export, smart switch, and restored current-account persistence passed.
- Packaged platform workflows: smoke-safe Codex launch, Cursor restart, launch-at-startup toggle, and tray actions passed.
- Windows app local verification on macOS host: `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm run build`, and `git diff --check` passed for the current Windows app change set.
- macOS regression gate: after `swift package clean`, `swift test` passed with 94 XCTest tests and 4 Swift Testing tests.

## Remaining Completion Evidence

The goal is not complete until a real Windows machine verifies the non-smoke behaviors below and produces a `scripts/collect_windows_verification.ps1 -RequireComplete` report:

- Installed app launches on Windows and opens Accounts.
- UI parity with the macOS app is checked from real Accounts, Proxy, and Settings screenshots or notes.
- Real ChatGPT OAuth completes in the Windows app.
- Current auth import, standalone auth import, account package import/export, account switch, and smart switch are verified against real local files.
- Usage refresh is verified with a real account or a visible user-facing usage error.
- Proxy start/stop is verified from the real Proxy page.
- Live proxy probes reach the selected real account for every supported route.
- Settings persist after app restart.
- Windows launch-at-startup registration is verified.
- Supported editor restart is verified with an installed editor.
- Codex launch after switch is verified against an installed Codex desktop app or CLI fallback.
- Tray menu behavior is verified on Windows.
